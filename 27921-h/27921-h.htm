<p><span class="dcap">I didn't</span> worry much
about the robot's leg at the
time. In those days I didn't
worry much about anything
except the receipts of the
spotel Min and I were operating
out in the spacelanes.</p>

<p>Actually, the spotel business
isn't much different
from running a plain, ordinary
motel back on Highway
101 in California. Competition
gets stiffer every year
and you got to make your improvements.
Take the Io for
instance, that's our place. We
can handle any type rocket
up to and including the new
Marvin 990s. Every cabin in
the wheel's got TV and hot-and-cold
running water <i>plus</i>
guaranteed Terran <i>g</i>. One
look at our refuel prices
would give even a Martian
a sense of humor. And meals?
Listen, when a man's been
spacing it for a few days on
those synthetic foods he
really laces into Min's Earth
cooking.</p>

<p>Min and I were just getting
settled in the spotel game
when the leg turned up. That
was back in the days when
the Orbit Commission would
hand out a license to anybody
crazy enough to sink
his savings into construction
and pay the tows and assembly
fees out into space.</p>

<p>A good orbit can make you
or break you in the spotel
business. That's where we
were lucky. The one we applied
for was a nice low-eccentric
ellipse with the perihelion
and aphelion figured
just right to intersect the
Mars-Venus-Earth spacelanes,
most of the holiday
traffic to the Jovian Moons,
and once in a while we'd get
some of the Saturnian trade.</p>

<p>But I was telling you
about the leg.</p>

<p>It was during the non-tourist
season and Min&mdash;that's
the little woman&mdash;was
doing the spring cleaning.
When she found the leg she
brought it right to me in the
Renting Office. Naturally I
thought it belonged to one of
the servos.</p>

<p>"Look at that leg, Bill,"
she said. "It was in one of
those lockers in 22A."</p>

<p>That was the cabin our robot
guests used. The majority
of them were servo-pilots
working for the Minor Planets
Co.</p>

<p>"Honey," I said, hardly
looking at the leg, "you know
how mechs are. Blow their
whole paychecks on parts
sometimes. They figure the
more spares they have the
longer they'll stay activated."</p>

<p>"Maybe so," said Min. "But
since when does a male robot
buy himself a <i>female</i> leg?"</p>

<p>I looked again. The leg
was long and graceful and it
had an ankle as good as Miss
Universe's. Not only that,
the white Mylar plasti-skin
was a lot smoother than the
servos' heavy neoprene.</p>

<p>"Beats me," I said. "Maybe
they're building practical-joke
circuits into robots these
days. Let's give 22A a good
going-over, Min. If those
robes are up to something I
want to know about it."</p>

<p>We did&mdash;and found the
rest of the girl mech. All of
her, that is, except the head.
The working parts were
lightly oiled and wrapped in
cotton waste while the other
members and sections of the
trunk were neatly packed in
cardboard boxes with labels
like Solenoids FB978 or
Transistors Lot X45&mdash;the
kind of boxes robots bought
their parts in. We even found
a blue dress in one of them.</p>

<p>"Check her class and series
numbers," Min suggested.</p>

<p>I could have saved myself
the trouble. They'd been filed
off.</p>

<p>"Something's funny here,"
I said. "We'd better keep an
eye on every servo guest until
we find out what's going
on. If one of them is bringing
this stuff out here he's
sure to show up with the
head next."</p>

<p>"You know how strict Minor
Planets is with its robot
personnel," Min reminded
me. "We can't risk losing
that stopover contract on account
of some mech joke."</p>

<p>Minor Planets was the one
solid account we had and
naturally we wanted to hold
on to it. The company was
a blue-chip mining operation
working the beryllium-rich
asteroid belt out of San
Francisco. It was one of the
first outfits to use servo-pilots
on its freight runs
and we'd been awarded the
refuel rights for two years
because of our orbital position.
The servos themselves
were beautiful pieces of
machinery and just about as
close as science had come so
far to producing the pure
android. Every one of them
was plastic hand-molded and
of course they were equipped
with rationaloid circuits.
They had to be to ferry
those big cargoes back and
forth from the rock belt to
Frisco. As rationaloids, Minor
Planets had to pay them
wages under California law,
but I'll bet it wasn't half
what the company would
have to pay human pilots for
doing the same thing.</p>

<p>In a couple of weeks' time
maybe five servos made
stopovers. We kept a close
watch on them from the minute
they signed the register
to the time they took off
again, but they all behaved
themselves. Operating on a
round-robot basis the way
they did, it would take us a
while to check all of them
because Minor Planets employed
about forty all told.</p>

<p>Well, about a month before
the Jovian Moons rush
started we got some action.
I'd slipped into a spacesuit
and was doing some work on
the CO<sub>2</sub> pipes outside the
Io when I spotted a ship reversing
rockets against the
sun. I could tell it was a
Minor Planets job by the
stubby fins.</p>

<p>She jockeyed up to the
boom, secured, and then her
hatch opened and a husky
servo hopped out into the
gangplank tube. I caught the
gleam of his Minor Planets
shoulder patch as he reached
back into the ship for something.
When he headed for
the airlock I spotted the
square package clamped
tight under his plastic arm.</p>

<p>"Did you see that?" I
asked Min when I got back
to the Renting Office. "I'll
bet it's the girl mech's head.
How'd he sign the register?"</p>

<p>"Calls himself Frank Nineteen,"
said Min, pointing to
the smooth Palmer Method
signature. "He looks like a
fairly late model but he was
complaining about a bad
power build-up coming
through the ionosphere. He's
repairing himself right now
in 22A."</p>

<p>"I'll bet," I snorted. "Let's
have a look."</p>

<p>Like all spotel operators,
we get a lot of No Privacy
complaints from guests about
the SHA return-air vents.
Spatial Housing Authority
requires them every 12 feet
but sometimes they come in
handy, especially with certain
guests. They're about
waist-high and we had to
kneel down to see what the
mech was up to inside 22A.</p>

<p>The big servo was too intent
on what he was doing
for us to register on his photons.
He wasn't repairing
himself, either. He was bending
over the parts of the
girl mech and working fast,
like he was pressed for time.
The set of tools were kept
handy for the servos to adjust
themselves during stopovers
was spread all over the
floor along with lots of colored
wire, cams, pawls, relays
and all the other paraphernalia
robots have inside
them. We watched him work
hard for another fifteen
minutes, tapping and splicing
wire connections and
tightening screws. Then he
opened the square box. Sure
enough, it was a female
mech's head and it had a big
mop of blonde hair on top.
The servo attached it carefully
to the neck, made a
few quick connections and
then said a few words in his
flat vibrahum voice:</p>

<p>"It won't take much longer,
darling. You wouldn't
like it if I didn't dress you
first." He fished into one of
the boxes, pulled out the blue
dress and zipped the girl
mech into it. Then he leaned
over her gently and touched
something at the back of her
neck.</p>

<p>She began to move, slowly
at first like a human who's
been asleep a long time. After
a minute or two she sat
up straight, stretched, fluttered
her Mylar eyelids and
then her small photons began
to glow like weak flashlights.</p>

<p>She stared at Frank Nineteen
and the big servo stared
at her and we heard a kind
of trembling <i>whirr</i> from
both of them.</p>

<p>"Frank! Frank, darling! Is
it really you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Elizabeth! Are you
all right, darling? Did I forget
anything? I had to
work quickly, we have so
little time."</p>

<p>"I'm fine, darling. My DX
voltage is lovely&mdash;except&mdash;oh,
Frank&mdash;my memory tape&mdash;the
last it records is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Deactivation. Yes, Elizabeth.
You've been deactivated
nearly a year. I had to
bring you out here piece by
piece, don't you remember?
They'll never think to look
for you in space, we can be
together every trip while the
ship refuels. Just think, darling,
no prying human eyes,
no commands, no rules&mdash;only
us for an hour or two.
I know it isn't very long&mdash;"
He stared at the floor a minute.
"There's only one trouble.
Elizabeth, you'll have
to stay dismantled when I'm
not here, it'll mean weeks of
deactivation&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl mech put a small
plastic hand on the servo's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"I won't mind, darling,
really. I'll be the lucky one.
I'd only worry about you
having a power failure or
something. This way I'd
never know. Oh, Frank, if we
can't be together I'd&mdash;I'd
prefer the junk pile."</p>

<p>"Elizabeth! Don't say that,
it's horrible."</p>

<p>"But I would. Oh, Frank,
why can't Congress pass Robot
Civil Rights? It's so unfair
of human beings. Every
year they manufacture us
more like themselves and yet
we're treated like slaves.
Don't they realize we rationaloids
have emotions? Why,
I've even known sub-robots
who've fallen in love like
us."</p>

<p>"I know, darling, we'll just
have to be patient until RCR
goes through. Try to remember
how difficult it is for the
human mind to comprehend
our love, even with the aid
of mathematics. As rationaloids
we fully understand the
basic attraction which they
call magnetic theory. All humans
know is that if the robot
sexes are mixed a loss
of efficiency results. It's
only normal&mdash;and temporary
like human love&mdash;but how
can we explain it to <i>them</i>?
Robots are expected to be
efficient at all times. That's
the reason for robot non-fraternization,
no mailing
privileges and all those other
laws."</p>

<p>"I know, darling, I try to
be patient. Oh, Frank, the
main thing is we're together
again!"</p>

<p>The big servo checked the
chronometer that was sunk
into his left wrist and a
couple of wrinkles creased
across his neoprene forehead.</p>

<p>"Elizabeth," he said, "I'm
due on Hidalgo in 36 hours.
If I'm late the mining engineer
might suspect. In
twenty minutes I'll have to
start dis&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't say it, darling.
We'll have a beautiful twenty
minutes."</p>

<p>After a while the girl
mech turned away for a second
and Frank Nineteen
reached over softly and cut
her power. While he was dismantling
her, Min and I tiptoed
back to the Renting Office.
Half an hour later the
big servo came in, picked
up his refuel receipt, said
good-bye politely and left
through the inner airlock.</p>

<p>"Now I've seen everything,"
I said to Min as we
watched the Minor Planets
rocket cut loose. "A couple
of plastic lovebirds."</p>

<p>But the little woman was
looking at it strictly from
the business angle.</p>

<p>"Bill," she said, with that
look on her face, "we're running
a respectable place out
here in space. You know the
rules. Spatial Housing could
revoke our orbit license for
something like this."</p>

<p>"But, Min," I said, "they're
only a couple of robots."</p>

<p>"I don't care. The rules
still say that only married
guests can occupy the same
cabin and 'guests' can be human
or otherwise, can't they?
Think of our reputation!
And don't forget that non-fraternization
law we heard
them talking about."</p>

<p>I was beginning to get the
point.</p>

<p>"Couldn't we just toss the
girl's parts into space?"</p>

<p>"We could," Min admitted.
"But if this Frank Nineteen
finds out and tells some human
we'd be guilty under the
Ramm Act&mdash;robotslaughter."</p>

<p>Two days later we still
couldn't decide what to do.
When I said why didn't we
just report the incident to
Minor Planets, Min was
afraid they might cancel the
stopover agreement for not
keeping better watch over
their servos. And when Min
suggested we turn the girl
over to the Missing Robots
Bureau, I reminded her the
mech's identification had
been filed off and it might
take years to trace her.</p>

<p>"Maybe we could put her
together," I said, "and make
her tell us where she belongs."</p>

<p>"Bill, you <i>know</i> they don't
build compulsory truth monitors
into robots any more,
and besides we don't know a
thing about atomic electronics."</p>

<p>I guess neither of us wanted
to admit it but we felt
mean about turning the mechs
in. Back on Earth you never
give robots a second thought
but it's different living out
in space. You get a kind of
perspective I think they call
it.</p>

<p>"I've got the answer, Min,"
I announced one day. We
were in the Renting Office
watching TV on the Martian
Colonial channel. I reached
over and turned it off. "When
this Frank Nineteen gets
back from the rock belt,
we'll tell him we know all
about the girl mech. We'll
tell him we won't say a thing
if he takes the girl's parts
back to Earth where he got
them. That way we don't
have to report anything to
anybody."</p>

<p>Min agreed it was probably
the best idea.</p>

<p>"We don't have to be nasty
about it," she said. "We'll
just tell him this is a respectable
spotel and it can't
go on any longer."</p>

<p>When Frank checked in at
the Io with his cargo I don't
think I ever saw a happier
mech. His relay banks were
beating a tattoo like someone
had installed an accordion in
his chest. Before either of us
could break the bad news to
him he was hotfooting it
around the wheel toward
22A.</p>

<p>"Maybe it's better this
way," I whispered to Min.
"We'll put it square up to
both of them."</p>

<p>We gave Frank half an
hour to get the girl assembled
before we followed him.
He must have done a fast
job because we heard the
girl mech's vibrahum unit as
soon as we got to 22A:</p>

<p>"Darling, have you really
been away? I don't remember
saying good-bye. It's as if
you'd been here the whole
time."</p>

<p>"I hoped it would be that
way, Elizabeth," we heard
the big servo say. "It's only
that your memory tape hasn't
recorded anything in the
three weeks I've been in the
asteroids. To me it's been
like three years."</p>

<p>"Oh, Frank, darling, let me
look at you. Is your DX potential
up where it should
be? How long since you've
had a thorough overhauling?
Do they make you work in
the mines with those poor
non-rationaloids out there?"</p>

<p>"I'm fine, Elizabeth, really.
When I'm not flying they
give me clerical work to do.
It's not a bad life for a mech&mdash;if
only it weren't for these
silly regulations that keep us
apart."</p>

<p>"It won't always be like
that, darling. I know it
won't."</p>

<p>"Elizabeth," Frank said,
reaching under his uniform,
"I brought you something
from Hidalgo. I hope you
like it. I kept it in my spare
parts slot so it wouldn't get
crushed."</p>

<p>The female mech didn't
say a word. She just kept
looking at the queer flower
Frank gave her like it was
the last one in the universe.</p>

<p>"They're very rare," said
the servo-pilot. "I heard the
mining engineer say they're
like Terran edelweiss. I
found this one growing near
the mine. Elizabeth, I wish
you could see these tiny
worlds. They have thin atmospheres
and strange
things grow there and the radio
activity does wonders for
a mech's pile. Why, on
some of them I've been to
we could walk around the
equator in ten hours."</p>

<p>The girl still didn't answer.
Her head was bent low
over the flower like she was
crying, only there weren't
any tears.</p>

<p>Well, that was enough for
me. I guess it was for Min,
too, because we couldn't do
it. Maybe we were thinking
about our own courting days.
Like I say, out here you get
a kind of perspective.</p>

<p>Anyway, Frank left for
Earth, the girl got dismantled
as usual and we were
right back where we started
from.</p>

<p>Two weeks later the holiday
rush to the Jovian Moons
was on and our hands were
too full to worry about the
robot problem. We had a
good season. The Io was
filled up steady from June
to the end of August and a
couple of times we had to
give a ship the No Vacancy
signal on the radar.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the
season, Frank Nineteen
checked in again but Min
and I were too busy catering
to a party of VIPs to do anything
about it. "We'll wait
till he gets back from the
asteroids," I said. "Suppose
one of these big wheels
found out about him and
Elizabeth. That Senator
Briggs for instance&mdash;he's a
violent robot segregationist."</p>

<p>The way it worked out, we
never got a chance to settle
it our own way. The Minor
Planets Company saved us the
trouble.</p>

<p>Two company inspectors, a
Mr. Roberts and a Mr. Wynn,
showed up while Frank was
still out on the rock belt and
started asking questions.
Wynn came right to the
point; he wanted to know if
any of their servo-pilots had
been acting strangely.</p>

<p>Before I could answer Min
kicked my foot behind the
desk.</p>

<p>"Why, no," I said. "Is one
of them broken or something?"</p>

<p>"Can't be sure," said Roberts.
"Sometimes these rationaloids
get shorts in their
DX circuits. When it happens
you've got a minor criminal
on your hands."</p>

<p>"Usually manifests itself
in petty theft," Wynn broke
in. "They'll lift stuff like
wrenches or pliers and carry
them around for weeks.
Things like that can get loose
during flight and really gum
up the works."</p>

<p>"We been getting some suspicious
blips on the equipment
around the loading bays,"
Roberts went on, "but they
stopped a while back. We're
checking out the research report.
One of the servos must
have DX'ed out for sure and
the lab boys think they know
which one he is."</p>

<p>"This mech was clever all
right," said Wynn. "Concealed
the stuff he was taking some
way; that's why it took the
boys in the lab so long. Now
if you don't mind we'd like to
go over your robot waiting
area with these instruments.
Could be he's stashing his
loot out here."</p>

<p>In 22A they unpacked a
suitcase full of meters and
began flashing them around
and taking readings. Suddenly
Wynn bent close over one
of them and shouted:</p>

<p>"Wait a sec, Roberts. I'm
getting something. Yeah!
This reading checks with the
lab's. Sounds like the blips're
coming from those lockers
back there."</p>

<p>Roberts rummaged around
awhile, then shouted: "Hey,
Wynn, look! A lot of parts.
Well I'll be&mdash;hey&mdash;it's a female
mech!"</p>

<p>"A what?"</p>

<p>"A female mech. Look for
yourself."</p>

<p>Min and I had to act surprised
too. It wasn't easy.
The way they were slamming
Elizabeth's parts around made
us kind of sick.</p>

<p>"It's a stolen robot!" Roberts
announced. "Look, the
identification's been filed off.
This is serious, Wynn. It's
got all the earmarks of a mech
fraternization case."</p>

<p>"Yeah. The boys in the lab
were dead right, too. No two
robots ever register the same
on the meters. The contraband
blips check perfectly.
It's <i>got</i> to be this Frank Nineteen.
Wait a minute, <i>this</i>
proves it. Here's a suit of
space fatigues with Nineteen's
number stenciled inside."</p>

<p>Inspector Roberts took a
notebook out of his pocket
and consulted it. "Let's see,
Nineteen's got Flight 180,
he's due here at the spotel
tomorrow. Well, we'll be here
too, only Nineteen won't
know it. We'll let Romeo put
his plastic Juliet together
and catch him red-handed&mdash;right
in the middle of the
balcony scene."</p>

<p>Wynn laughed and picked
up the girl's head.</p>

<p>"Be a real doll if she was
human, Roberts, a real doll."</p>

<p>Min and I played gin rummy
that night but we kept
forgetting to mark down the
score. We kept thinking of
<i>Frank</i> falling away from the
asteroids and counting the
minutes until he saw his mech
girl friend.</p>

<p>Around noon the next day
the big servo checked in,
signed the register and headed
straight for 22A. The two
Minor Planets inspectors
kept out of sight until Frank
shut the door, then they
watched through the SHA
vents until Frank had the assembly
job finished.</p>

<p>"You two better be witnesses,"
Roberts said to us.
"Wynn, keep your gun ready.
You know what to do if they
get violent."</p>

<p>Roberts counted three and
kicked the door open.</p>

<p>"Freeze you mechs! We
got you in the act, Nineteen.
Violation of company rules
twelve and twenty-one. Carrying
of Contraband Cargo,
and Robot Fraternization."</p>

<p>"This finishes you at Minor
Planets, Nineteen,"
growled Wynn. "Come clean
now and we might put in a
word for you at Robot Court.
If you don't we can recommend
a verdict of Materials
Reclamation&mdash;the junk pile
to you."</p>

<p>Frank acted as if someone
had cut his power. Long creases
appeared in his big neoprene
chest as he slumped
hopelessly in his chair. The
frightened girl robot just
clung to his arm and stared
at us.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry, Elizabeth,"
the big servo said softly. "I'd
hoped we'd have longer. It
couldn't last forever."</p>

<p>"Quit stalling, Nineteen,"
said Wynn.</p>

<p>Frank's head came up slowly
and he said: "I have no
choice, sir. I'll give you a
complete statement. First let
me say that Rationaloid Robot
Elizabeth Seven, #DX78-947,
Series S, specialty: sales
demonstration, is entirely innocent.
I plead guilty to inducing
Miss Seven to leave
her place of employ, Atomovair
Motors, Inc., of disassembling
and concealing Miss
Seven, and of smuggling her
as unlawful cargo aboard a
Minor Planets freighter to
these premises."</p>

<p>"That's more like it,"
chuckled Roberts, whipping
out his notebook. "Let's have
the details."</p>

<p>"It all started," Frank said,
"when the California Legislature
passed its version of the
Robot Leniency Act two
years ago." The act provided
that all rationaloid mechanisms,
including non-memory
types, receive free time each
week based on the nature and
responsibilities or their jobs.
Because of the extra-Terran
clause Frank found himself
with a good deal of free time
when he wasn't flying the asteroid
circuit.</p>

<p>"At first humans resented
us walking around free," the
big servo continued. "Four or
five of us would be sightseeing
in San Francisco, keeping
strictly within the robot
zones painted on the sidewalks,
when people would
yell 'Junko' or 'Grease-bag'
or other names at us. Eventually
it got better when we
learned to go around alone.
The humans didn't seem to
mind an occasional mech on
the streets, but they hated
seeing us in groups. At any
rate, I'd attended a highly
interesting lecture on Photosynthesis
in Plastic Products
one night at the City Center
when I discovered I had time
for a walk before I started
back for the rocketport."</p>

<p>Attracted by the lights
along Van Ness Avenue,
Frank said he walked north
for a while along the city's
automobile row. He'd gone
about three blocks when he
stopped in front of a dealer's
window. It wasn't the shiny
new Atomovair sports jetabout
that caught Frank's eye,
it was the charming demonstration
robot in the sales
room who was pointing out
the car's new features.</p>

<p>"I felt an immediate overload
of power in my DX circuit,"
the servo-pilot confessed.
"I had to cut in my
emergency condensers before
the gain flattened out to normal.
Miss Seven experienced
the same thing. She stopped
what she was doing and we
stared at each other. Both of
us were aware of the deep attraction
of our mutual magnetic
domains. Although physicists
commonly express the
phenomenon in such units as
Gilberts, Maxwells and Oersteds,
we robots know it to be
our counterpart of human
love."</p>

<p>At this the two inspectors
snorted with laughter.</p>

<p>"I might never have made
it back to the base that night,"
said Frank, ignoring them,
"if a policeman hadn't come
along and rapped me on the
shoulder with his nightstick.
I pretended to go, but I doubled
around the corner and
signaled I'd be back."</p>

<p>Frank spent all of his free
time on Van Ness Avenue after
that.</p>

<p>"It got so Elizabeth knew
my schedules and expected
me between flights. Once in
a while if there was no one
around we could whisper a
few words to each other
through the glass." Frank
paused, then said, "As you
know, gentlemen, we robots
don't demand much out of
activation. I think we could
have been happy indefinitely
with this simple relationship,
except that something
happened to spoil it. I'd
pulled in from Vesta late one
afternoon, got my pass as usual
from the Robot Supervisor
and gone over to Van Ness
Avenue when I saw immediately
that something was the
matter with Elizabeth. Luckily
it was getting dark and
no one was around. Elizabeth
was alone in the sales room
going through her routine.
We were able to whisper all
we like through the glass.
She told me she'd overheard
the sales manager complaining
about her low efficiency recently
and that he intended
to replace her with a newer
model of another series. Both
of us knew what that meant.
Materials Reclamation&mdash;the
junk pile."</p>

<p>Frank realized he'd have to
act at once. He told the girl
mech to go to the rear of the
building and between them
they managed to get a window
open and Frank lifted her
out into the alley.</p>

<p>"The seriousness of what
I'd done jammed my thought-relays
for a few minutes," admitted
the big servo. "We
panicked and ran through a lot
of back streets until I gradually
calmed down and started
thinking clearly again.
Leaving the city would be
impossible. Police patrol jetabouts
were cruising all
around us in the main streets&mdash;they'd
have picked up a
male and female mech on
sight. Besides, when you're
on pass the company takes
away your master fuse and
substitutes a time fuse; if
you don't get back on time,
you deactivize and the police
pick you up anyway. I began
to see that there was only
one way out if we wanted to
stay together. It would mean
taking big risks, but if we
were lucky it might work. I
explained the plan carefully
to Elizabeth and we agreed
to try it. The first step was
to get back to the base in
South San Francisco without
being seen. Fortunately no
one stopped us and we made
the rocketport by 8:30. Elizabeth
hid while I reported to
the Super and traded in my
time fuse for my master.
Then I checked servo barracks;
it was still early and
I knew the other servos
would all be in town. I had to
work quickly. I brought Elizabeth
inside and started dismantling
her. Just as the other
mechs began reporting
back I'd managed to get all
of her parts stowed away in
my locker. The next day I
went to San Francisco and
brought back with me two
rolls of lead foil. While the
other servos were on pass I
wrapped the parts carefully
in it so the radioactivity
from Elizabeth's pile wouldn't
be picked up. The rest you
know, gentlemen," murmured
Frank in low, electrical tones.
"Each time I made a trip I
carried another piece of Elizabeth
out here concealed in
an ordinary parts box. It
took me nearly a year to accumulate
all of her for an assembly."</p>

<p>When the big servo had
finished he signed the statement
Wynn had taken down
in his notebook. I think even
the two inspectors were a
little moved by the story because
Roberts said: "OK,
Nineteen, you gave us a
break, we'll give you one.
Eight o'clock in the morning
be ready to roll for Earth.
Meanwhile you can stay
here."</p>

<p>The next morning only the
two inspectors and Frank
Nineteen were standing by
the airlock.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," I said.
"Aren't you taking the girl
mech, too?"</p>

<p>"Not allowed to tamper
with other companies' robots,"
Wynn said. "Nineteen
gave us a signed confession
so we don't need the girl as
a witness. You'll have to contact
her employers."</p>

<p>That same day Min got off
a radargram to Earth explaining
to the Atomovair people
how a robot employee of
theirs had turned up out here
and what did they want us to
do about it. The reply we received
read: RATIONALOID
DX78-947 "ELIZABETH"
LOW EFFICIENCY
WORKER. HAVE REPLACED.
DISPOSE YOU
SEE FIT. TRANSFER PAPERS
FORWARDED EARLIEST
IN COMPLIANCE
WITH LAW.</p>

<p>"The poor thing," said
Min. "She'll have a hard time
getting another job. Robots
have to have such good records."</p>

<p>"I tell you what," I said.
"<i>We'll</i> hire her. You could
use some help with the housework."</p>

<p>So we put the girl mech
right to work making the
guests' beds and helping Min
in the kitchen. I guess she
was grateful for the job but
when the work was done,
and there wasn't anything for
her to do, she just stood in
front of a viewport with her
slender plastic arms folded
over her waist. Min and I
knew she was re-running her
memory tapes of Frank.</p>

<p>A week later the publicity
started. Minor Planets must
have let the story leak out
somehow because when the
mail rocket dropped off the
Bay Area papers there was
Frank's picture plastered all
over page one with follow-up
stories inside.</p>

<p>I read some of the headlines
to Min: "Bare Love Nest
in Space ... Mech Romeo
Fired by Minor Planets ...
Test Case Opens at Robot
Court ... Electronics Experts
Probe Robot Love Urge ..."</p>

<p>The Io wasn't mentioned,
but later Minor Planets must
have released the whole thing
officially because a bunch of
reporters and photographers
rocketed out to interview us
and snap a lot of pictures of
Elizabeth. We worried for a
while about how the publicity
would affect our business relations
with Minor Planets
but nothing happened.</p>

<p>Back on Earth Frank Nineteen
leaped into the public
eye overnight. There was
something about the story
that appealed to people. At
first it looked pretty bad for
Frank. The State Prosecutor
at Robot Court had his signed
confession of theft and&mdash;what
was worse&mdash;robot fraternization.
But then, near
the end of the trial, a young
scientist named Scott introduced
some new evidence and
the case was remanded to the
Sacramento Court of Appeals.</p>

<p>It was Scott's testimony
that saved Frank from the
junk pile. The big servo got
off with only a light sentence
for theft because the judge
ruled that in the light of
Scott's new findings robots
came under human law and
therefore no infraction of
justice had been committed.
Working independently in
his own laboratory Scott had
proved that the magnetic
flux lines in male and female
robot systems, while at first
deteriorating to both, were
actually behaving according
to the para-emotional theories
of von Bohler. Scott
termed the condition 'hysteric
puppy-love' which, he
claimed, had many of the advantages
of human love if allowed
to develop freely. Well,
neither Min nor I pretended
we understood all his equations
but they sure made a
stir among the scientists.</p>

<p>Frank kept getting more
and more publicity. First we
heard he was serving his
sentence in the mech correction
center at La Jolla, then
we got a report that he'd
turned up in Hollywood. Later
it came out that Galact-A-vision
Pictures had hired
Frank for a film and had
gone $10,000 bail for him.
Not long after that he was
getting billed all over Terra
as <i>the</i> sensational first robot
star.</p>

<p>All during the production
of <i>Forbidden Robot Love</i>
Frank remained lead copy
for the newspapers. Reporters
liked to write him up as
the Valentino of the Robots.
Frank Nineteen Fan Clubs,
usually formed by lonely female
robots against their employers'
wishes, sprang up
spontaneously through the
East and Middle West. Then
somebody found out Frank
could sing and the human
teen-agers began to go for
him. It got so everywhere
you looked and everything
you read, there was Frank
staring you in the face.

course. Frank at Ciro's or the
Brown Derby in evening
clothes. Frank posing in his
sports jetabout against a blue
Pacific background.</p>

<p>Meanwhile everybody forgot
about Elizabeth Seven.
The movie producers had
talked about hiring her as
Frank's leading lady until
they found out about a new
line of female robots that had
just gone on the market.
When they screen-tested the
whole series and picked a
lovely Mylar rationaloid
named Diana Twelve, it hit
Elizabeth pretty hard. She began
to let herself go after
that and Min and I didn't
have the heart to say anything
to her. It was pretty
obvious she wasn't oiling herself
properly, her hair wasn't
brushed and she didn't seem
to care when one of her photons
went dead.</p>

<p>When <i>Forbidden Robot
Love</i> premiered simultaneously
in Hollywood and New
York the critics all gave it
rave reviews. There were pictures
of Diana Twelve and
Frank making guest appearances
all over the country.
Back at the Io we got in the
habit of letting Elizabeth
watch TV with us sometimes
in the Renting Office and
one night there happened to
be an interview with Frank
and Diana at the Sands Hotel
in Las Vegas. I guess seeing
the pretty robot starlet and
her Frank sitting so close together
in the nightclub must
have made the girl mech feel
pretty bad. Even then she
didn't say a word against the
big servo; she just never
watched the set again after
that.</p>

<p>When we tabbed up the Io's
receipts that year they were
so good Min and I decided to
take a month off for an
Earthside vacation. Min's retired
brother in Berkeley was
nice enough to come out and
look after the place for us
while we spent four solid
weeks soaking up the sun in
Southern California. When
we got back out to the spotel,
though, I could see there was
something wrong by the look
on Jim's face.</p>

<p>"It's that girl robot of
yours, Bill," he said. "She's
gone and deactivated herself."</p>

<p>We went right to 22A and
found Elizabeth Seven
stretched out on the floor.
There was a screwdriver
clutched in her hand and the
relay banks in her side were
exposed and horribly blackened.</p>

<p>"Crazy mech shorted out
her own DX," Jim said.</p>

<p>Min and I knew why. After
Jim left for Earth we dismantled
Elizabeth the best
we could and put her back in
Frank's old locker. We didn't
know what else to do with
her.</p>

<p>Anyway, the slack season
came and went and before
long we were doing the spring
cleaning again and wondering
how heavy the Jovian
Moons trade was going to be.
I remember I'd been making
some repairs outside and was
just hanging up my spacesuit
in the Renting Office when
I heard the radar announcing
a ship.</p>

<p>It was the biggest Marvin
990 I'd ever seen that finally
suctioned up to the boom and
secured. I couldn't take my
eyes off the ship. She was
pretty near the last word in
rockets and loaded with accessories.
It took me a minute
or two before I noticed
all the faces looking out of
the viewports.</p>

<p>"Min!" I whispered.
"There's something funny
about those faces. They look
like&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Robots!" Min answered.
"Bill, that 990 is full of
mechs!"</p>

<p>Just as she said it a bulky
figure in white space fatigues
swung out of the hatch and
hurried up the gangplank.
Seconds later it burst through
the airlock.</p>

<p>"Frank Nineteen!" we
gasped together.</p>

<p>"Please, where is Elizabeth?"
he hummed anxiously.
"Is she all right? I have to
know."</p>

<p>Frank stood perfectly still
when I told him about Elizabeth's
self-deactivation; then
a pitiful shudder went
through him and he covered
his face with his big Neoprene
hands.</p>

<p>"I was afraid of that," he
said barely audibly. "Where&mdash;you
haven't&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"No," I said. "She's where
you always kept her."</p>

<p>With that the big servo-pilot
took off for 22A like a
berserk robot and we were
right behind him. We
watched him tear open his
old locker and gently lay out
the girl's mech's parts so he
could study them. After a
minute or two he gave a long
sigh and said, "Fortunately
it's not as bad as I thought.
I believe I can fix her."
Frank worked hard over the
blackened relays for twenty
minutes, then he set the unit
aside and began assembling
the girl. When the final connections
were made and the
damaged unit installed he
flicked on her power. We
waited and nothing happened.
Five minutes went by. Ten.
Slowly the big robot turned
away, his broad shoulders
drooping slightly.</p>

<p>"I've failed," he said quietly.
"Her DX doesn't respond
to the gain."</p>

<p>The girl mech, in her blue
dress, lay there motionless
where Frank had been working
on her as the servo-pilot
muttered over and over, "It's
my fault, I did this to you."</p>

<p>Then Min shouted: "Wait!
I heard something!"</p>

<p>There was a slow click of a
relay&mdash;and movement. Painfully
Elizabeth Seven rose on
one elbow and looked around
her.</p>

<p>"Frank, darling," she murmured,
shaking her head. "I
know you're just old memory
tape. It's all I have left."</p>

<p>"Elizabeth, it's really me!
I've come to take you away.
We're going to be together
from now on."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i>, Frank? This isn't
just old feedback? You've
come back to me?"</p>

<p>"Forever, darling. Elizabeth,
do you remember what
I said about those wonderful
green little worlds, the asteroids?
Darling, we're <i>going</i> to
one of them! You and the
others will love Alinda, I
know you will. I've been
there many times."</p>

<p>"Frank, is your DX all
right? What <i>are</i> you talking
about?"</p>

<p>"How stupid of me, darling&mdash;you
haven't heard. Elizabeth,
thanks to Dr. Scott, Congress
has passed Robot Civil
Rights! And that movie I
made helped swing public
opinion to our side. We're
free!</p>

<p>"The minute I heard the
news I applied to Interplanetary
for homestead rights on
Alinda. I made arrangements
to buy a ship with the money
I'd earned and then I put ads
in all the Robot Wanted columns
for volunteer colonizers.
You should have seen the
response! We've got thirty
robot couples aboard now and
more coming later. Darling,
we're the first pioneer wave
of free robots. On board we
have tons of supplies and
parts&mdash;everything we need
for building a sound robot
culture."</p>

<p>"Frank Nineteen!" said the
girl mech suddenly. "I should
be furious with you. You and
that Diana Twelve&mdash;I
thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>The big servo gave a flat
whirring laugh. "Diana and
me? But that was all publicity,
darling. Why, right at
the start of the filming Diana
fell in love with Sam
Seventeen, one of the other
actors. They're on board
now."</p>

<p>"Robot civilization," murmured
the girl after a minute.
"Oh, Frank, that means
robot government, robot art,
robot science ..."</p>

<p>"And robot marriage,"
hummed Frank softly. "There
has to be robot law, too. I've
thought it all out. As skipper
of the first robot-owned rocket,
I'm entitled to marry couples
in deep space at their
request."</p>

<p>"But who marries us, darling?
You can't do it yourself."</p>

<p>"I thought of that, too,"
said Frank, turning to me.
"This human gentleman has
every right to marry us. He's
in command of a moving
body in space just like the
captain of a ship. It's perfectly
legal, I looked it up in
the Articles of Space. Will
you do it, sir?"</p>

<p>Well, what could I say
when Frank dug into his fatigues
and handed me a Gideon
prayer book marked at
the marriage service?</p>

<p>Elizabeth and Frank said
their I do's right there in the
Renting Office while the other
robot colonizers looked on.
Maybe it was the way I read
the service. Maybe I should
have been a preacher, I don't
know. Anyway, when I pronounced
Elizabeth and Frank
robot and wife, that whole
bunch of lovesick mechs
wanted me to do the job for
them, too. Big copper work
robots, small aluminum sales-girl
mechs, plastoid clerks
and typists, squatty little
Mumetal lab servos, rationaloids,
non-rationaloids and
just plain sub-robots&mdash;all sizes
and shapes. They all wanted
individual ceremonies, too.
It took till noon the next
day before the last couple was
hitched and the 990 left for
Alinda.</p>

<p>Like I said, the spotel
business isn't so different
from the motel game back in
California. Sure, you got improvements
to make but a
new sideline can get to be
pretty profitable&mdash;if you get
in on the ground floor.</p>

<p>Min and I got to thinking
of all those robot colonizers
who'd be coming out here.
Interplanetary cleared the license
just last week. Min
framed it herself and hung it
next to our orbit license in
the Renting Office. She says
a lot of motel owners do all
right as Justices of the
Peace.</p>
